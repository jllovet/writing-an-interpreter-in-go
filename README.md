# Writing an Interpreter in Go

This repository contains my implementation of the Monkey programming language, which I'm building as I read through Thorsten Ball's books "Writing an Interpreter in Go".

## A Note on Reading Notes

I am including my reading notes here for reference and discussion as I read through the book. The notes are pulled from my personal Obsidian Vault, and at the time I am writing this, I am not planning on setting up a parallel vault for this. Consequently, there will be broken links that were present and working in Obsidian that will likely not work when reading the notes in this repository.
